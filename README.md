## Overview

Predicting weather conditions accurately is crucial for a wide range of applications, from agriculture and transportation to disaster management. This project focuses on developing a weather prediction model that employs the Ridge Regression algorithm to achieve a remarkable accuracy of around 97%. By utilizing a diverse set of predictors, the model is capable of making reliable predictions for various weather parameters.

## Model Architecture

The weather prediction model is built using the following components:

1. **Data Collection:** A comprehensive dataset containing various weather-related features is collected and preprocessed.

2. **Feature Selection:** To ensure accurate predictions, a careful selection of predictors is performed. This step involves analyzing the dataset, identifying relevant features, and removing any irrelevant or redundant ones.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** The selected features are then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for model training.

4. **Ridge Regression:** The core of the model is built using the Ridge Regression algorithm. Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that incorporates L2 regularization, helping prevent overfitting and enhancing the model's generalization capability.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. This step ensures that the model meets the desired accuracy level.

6. **Predictions:** Once trained, the model can accept input data and provide predictions for various weather parameters, enabling users to make informed decisions based on accurate predictions.
